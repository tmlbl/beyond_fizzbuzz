Fizzbuzz.js demonstrates a classic implementation of numbers 1 through 100, but taking the keys as parameters in an object literal. To run, use:

`node fizzbuzz.js`

Fizzfunction.js demonstrates an extensible function that can FizzBuzz over any number of name:value keys and takes the number as a parameter. The object is called in objtest.js and can be run with:

`node test.js`

Happy fizzing.
